# FICO Hacking Calendar
### What is this?
A calendar file you can import to Google Calendar or Calendar that sets up a recurring event on the last weekday of each month, which is typically before the billing cycle closes and your credit card finalizes your billing statement.

*Note that this will only work if your billing cycle does not end before the month is up. To my knowledge, it is not possible to set a recurring calendar event that occurs on the last weekday before the nth day of a month.*
### What's the purpose of this anyways?
To maximize the utilization section of your credit score, it is best to practice the $2/$3 rule (TL;DR: Have a little usage as possible while still being registered as having some usage. $2 is the sweet spot for most credit cards, but some like Discover will count $2 as having no overall usage in the billing cycle, so we use $3 for such cards).

> Your billing cycles might look like this:
Days 1-28: Use card normally
Day 29: Pay off entire balance minus $3
Day 30: End of statement, statement balance will be $3
Day 31: Pay off $3 statement balance, go back to Day 1 and start over.
